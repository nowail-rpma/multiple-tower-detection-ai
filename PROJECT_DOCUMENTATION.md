# Tower Detection AI - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

**Tower Detection AI** is a comprehensive web application that uses YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model to detect and analyze mobile communication towers, their components, and maintenance issues from uploaded images. The system provides real-time detection with confidence scores, bounding box visualization, and detailed classification of 21 different tower-related objects.

## Model file naming

By default the application looks for `best.pt`. You can change this by setting the `MODEL_PATH` environment variable. The model file is a **PyTorch model checkpoint** that contains the trained YOLOv11 neural network weights and architecture. It contains:

- **Neural Network Weights**: The learned parameters from training on thousands of tower images
- **Model Architecture**: The structure of the YOLOv11 model optimized for tower detection
- **Class Mappings**: 21 different classes of towers, equipment, and damage indicators
- **Training Metadata**: Information about the training process and model performance

### Key Details about best.pt:

- **Format**: PyTorch serialized model (.pt extension)
- **Size**: Typically 50-200MB depending on model complexity
- **Purpose**: Pre-trained model specifically trained for tower detection
- **Usage**: Loaded by the Flask backend to perform real-time inference on uploaded images
